Prototype

## Prerequisites

Install **proto** (https://moonrepo.dev/proto) to synchronize languages and tools.

Run `proto install`.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
